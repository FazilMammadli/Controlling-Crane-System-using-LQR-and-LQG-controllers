# Controlling-Crane-System-using-LQR-and-LQG-controllers

## ENPM 667 Final Project

This repository is dedicated to the ENPM 667 Final Project at the University of Maryland, College Park. It contains MATLAB code for the analysis and design of a control system for a crane with two suspended loads, as well as the final project report. Each code file corresponds to a different aspect of the project, including observability analysis, Luenberger observer design, LQR controller design, and LQG controller implementation.

### Repository Contents

- `E_Observability.m`: MATLAB code for the observability analysis of the crane system.
- `F_Luenberger.m`: MATLAB code for designing a Luenberger observer for the system.
- `G_LQG.m`: MATLAB code for the implementation of the LQG controller.
- `LQR.m`: MATLAB code for designing an LQR controller for the linearized system.
- `LQR_Non_linear.m`: MATLAB code for applying the LQR controller to the non-linear system.
- `observability.m`: MATLAB code for additional observability checks.
- `Group4_gayatrid_absiddiq_mammadli.pdf`: The final technical report that includes detailed explanations, methodologies, and findings of the project.
  
### Running the Code
Each MATLAB file can be run in MATLAB to observe different behaviors and analysis results:

To perform observability analysis, run E_Observability.m.
For Luenberger observer design, execute F_Luenberger.m.
To implement and simulate the LQG controller, run G_LQG.m.
For LQR controller design and simulation on the linearized system, execute LQR.m.
To apply the LQR controller to the non-linear system, run LQR_Non_linear.m.

### Project Report
The final report Group4_gayatrid_absiddiq_mammadli.pdf contains comprehensive details on the project's background, methodology, analyses, and conclusions. It is recommended to read the report for a thorough understanding of the project objectives and outcomes.
